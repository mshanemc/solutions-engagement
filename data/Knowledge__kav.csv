"What Is The Difference Between PTO and Sick Time?","What-Is-The-Difference-Between-PTO-and-Sick-Time","Paid time off is a bank of hours from which employees can draw. Your PTO balance covers vacation time as well as sick days. Under this program, it does not matter to the company whether your PTO is for vacation or sick time, and the accruals allow for both. Please note, however, that since PTO is intended to cover sick time, employees should remain home when sick rather than coming into the office and risk infecting others. Employees who come to work sick will be asked to leave and stay home while they recover."
